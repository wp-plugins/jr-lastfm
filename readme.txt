== Description ==

This Last.FM plugin allows you to show your recently listened to tracks on Last.FM as a widget on your blog.

It will display these tracks as a list, with hyperlinks to the URLs on Last.FM so your users can see what music you like to listen to.

In version 1.1.0, there are 2 different widgets - One to show your recently played tracks and another to show your most played tracks!

You can now also show a list of your friends on Last.FM with a separate widget!

It's also very easy to show your user shouts as a widget too!

Installing it is also very simple. See the installation menu for instructions.
